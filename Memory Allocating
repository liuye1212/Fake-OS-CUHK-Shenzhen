 * MemoryAllocating.h
 * This is memory allocating part done by Dorothy.
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * The idea to implement it is stated as following:
 * We first need to define a map called "FunctionList" to relate every function with a representative value of it.
 * For example Tetris -- 1, Snake Game --2, etc. which is similar to area code we did in the assignment.
 * Use an int array with a specific size to simulate the whole memory space. array[whole_size]
 * When memory is available to use, it has value 0, therefore the initial memory array is an array with all values 0.
 * Given the size of memory that one program needs, we allocate some part of the memory to it. 
 * For example, if Tetris starts running, and the size it needs is 20, then we will allocate array [0] = ... = array [20] = 1.
 * When the job ends, free corresponding part of the array by assigning value to be 0 again to make this part memory available again.
 * for examole, when we ends Tetris, we should assign array[0] = ... = array[20] = 0.
 * Also need to include a method that can clear the whole memory space, which is just assign all value to be 0.
 * The Algorithm to allocate the memory is that it always starts from the beginning, and it can split into pieces in order to save memory space.
 * Use an example to illustrate it: if we have 2 functions are running, with representative value 1 and 2 respectively, and assume both sizes are 20
 * then we will assign array[0] = .. = array[19] = 1, then array[20] = ... = array[30] = 2, that means we allocate memory to these 2 functions.
 * now, if we ends function 1, we just need to assign array[0] = ... = array[19] = 0 to mean that 0-20 is available again.
 * If we now need to start a new function 3 with size 30, we need to split this 30 to be 20 + 10, since the array[20] .. array[39] have been occupied.
 * Then we just assign array[0] = ... = array[19] = 3, and array[40] = ... = array[49] = 3. 
 * which means it occupies the first 20 positions and 40th to 49th position, in total, it's also of size 30.
